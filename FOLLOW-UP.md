# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
Almost four hours.

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Would fix the Select component bug - to show the selected item - and maybe show the icon and category provided.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
Been able do learn the basics of React in the given time. It was my first time using it as a dev tool and it was fun to learn.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I did spend the most of the time in the front end, trying to use the React components properly. That was challenging but rewarded.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
It was challenging, most of it, but straightforward and also fun. Read the ChuckFacts gave me chucles lol. I have no sugestions right now, but will be happy to let you know if some comes to my mind.
Btw, thanks for the opportunity!
